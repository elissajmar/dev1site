        <div>
            Busy college students often face the problem of having too much to carry. With multiple bags in tow, it's
            inconvenient and uncomfortable to go about daily life. Many gym bags today are not designed with convenience
            in mind. But Stratagym is different.
        </div>

        <div class="heading">
            Our company mission is to empower individuals who lead an active and busy lifestyle by providing an
            affordable and convenient solution for carrying gym and other essentials, all while transitioning from the
            class to the gym.

            <div>
                Our flagship product, Stratagym, is a durable and lightweight attachable gym bag that can be easily
                hooked onto any backpack or tote bag. It has multiple compartments to store gym essentials such as a
                water bottle, towel, change of clothes, and personal belongings such as a phone or wallet. It is made of
                high-quality materials such as waterproof nylon and durable zippers, making it suitable for everyday
                use. We plan to expand our product line in the future to include other gym-related accessories such as
                workout gloves, sweatbands, and fitness trackers.

                Target Market
            </div>
            We estimate that our target market of young adults (college and high school students) who regularly go to
            the gym or participate in sports represents at least 10% of the overall fitness industry. This translates to
            a Total Attainable Market size of $9.6 billion in 2023. Assuming we capture even 1% of this market, our
            revenue from the Service Obtainable Market in 2023 would be approximately $96 million, expecting an average
            product price of $30. As we grow our brand and expand our market reach, we expect to capture a higher
            percentage of the market and increase our revenue accordingly.
            <br> <br>The University of Southern California presents an excellent starting point for Paris 'N Friends Co.
            to introduce Stratagym to a large and receptive market. With a student population of approximately 49,000,
            the USC community is known for its strong emphasis on academics, athletics, and overall wellness. Many
            students are actively involved in fitness-related activities, whether it be hitting the gym, participating
            in sports, or taking part in fitness classes. As students, we are uniquely positioned to connect with our
            peers and develop targeted marketing strategies that effectively communicate the benefits of Stratagym. By
            working closely with the USC community, we believe that we can establish a strong brand presence and expand
            our reach to other audiences across the country.
            <br /><br />
            <strong>tl;dr Market Niche </strong><br />
            Students who frequent the gym during the day but do not have time to run back to their dorms/apartments to
            put their gym bag away between classes.

            <div class="heading">
                Marketing and Sales Strategy
            </div>
            <div>We plan to leverage social media platforms such as Instagram and TikTok to target our young audience.
                Influencer marketing will potentially play a significant role in our marketing strategy, as we further
                consider partnering with fitness influencers and college students with a strong social media presence.
                We will also attend college fairs and sports events to promote our product and interact with potential
                customers. We will offer seasonal discounts and referral programs to encourage customer loyalty and
                increase our customer base.
                <br /> <br />In addition to leveraging social media and attending college fairs, we conducted a robust
                survey to test the market's interest in our product. The survey consisted of a set of questions related
                to gym habits, current gym bag usage, and interest in an attachable gym bag. Based on the results, we
                found that a significant percentage of students were interested in using an attachable gym bag, and the
                feedback we received was overwhelmingly positive.
                <br /><br />
                <img src="assets/market research.png" style="width: 700px;">
                <br> <br>To further validate our findings and connect with potential customers, we plan to conduct an
                in-person product pitch at the USC Lyon Center and USC Village Gym. This will give us the opportunity to
                interact with our target market, gather feedback, and make sales. We believe that this direct approach
                will be an effective way to build brand awareness and establish a loyal customer base. We will also use
                this opportunity to gather insights into our target market's preferences, which will inform future
                product development and marketing strategies.
                <br> <br> We believe that Stratagym is a disruptive innovation within the multi-function carrying
                apparatus (bags) market, and we are pursuing a design patent to protect our product. A design patent
                will give us exclusive rights to our product's unique design and prevent competitors from replicating
                it. This will be crucial in establishing Stratagym as the most competitive product in terms of
                price-to-performance and distinctive brand in the gym bag market.
                <br> <br>Furthermore, we plan to establish strategic partnerships with gyms and fitness centers to
                expand our reach and build brand recognition. Our goal is to collaborate with establishments that share
                our values and cater to our target market. We are also pursuing discussions with the USC Bookstore to
                sell Stratagym as a point of sale. The USC Bookstore has a high footfall of students and will give us an
                excellent opportunity to make sales and reach our target market. We are also exploring the possibility
                of partnering with other universities and colleges to expand our market reach beyond the USC community.
                <br> <br>In summary, we believe that Stratagym has significant market potential, and we have a robust
                marketing and sales strategy in place to capitalize on this potential. By pursuing a design patent,
                establishing strategic partnerships, and exploring potential high-value points of sale, we are confident
                that we can make Stratagym a success in the multi-function carrying apparatus (bags) gym bag market.
